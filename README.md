## Purpose

I have created this repo as a notebook for Linux commands. I have recently switched from Windows to Linux and I taught it might be useful to save the main bash commands somewhere.
I also might add some git commands, vim commands and some commands specific to certain distros such as Debian or Arch, depending on what I feel like testing/installing.

## Keyboard Shortcuts in terminal

CTRL + L => cleares the terminal, same as `clear` command

CTRL + D => closes the shell

CTRL + U => removes the current line

CTRL + A => moves the cursor at the start of the line

CTRL + E => moves the cursor at the end of the line

CTRL + C => stops the current command



##Getting Help
